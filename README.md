# flocking-satellites

A demonstration of the flocking algorithm invented by Craig Reynolds (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/). A swarm of satellites is conceptualized in 2D as they progress in their orbit, at the same time utilizing flocking to avoid oncoming space debris without degrading their formation.
