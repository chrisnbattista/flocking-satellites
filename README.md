# flocking-satellites

A partial demonstration of the flocking algorithm invented by Craig Reynolds (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/). A swarm of satellites is conceptualized in 2D as they progress in their orbit, at the same time utilizing flocking to cooperatively maintain formation under disturbance.

This simple demo implements attractors and repulsors for cooperative control. Attitude control, the third element of the original flocking element, has not been implemented, as satellite attitude is likely to be constrained by mission requirements.
